 Execution Algorithms for Autonomous Warehouse Robot
 
1. Task Initialization
- Receive order from Warehouse Management System (WMS)
- Identify product location in inventory
- Assign task to the most available robot

2. Path Planning Algorithm
Algorithm Used: A* Search or Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Calculate shortest path from robot position to item shelf
- Avoid blocked paths and dynamic obstacles
- Optimize for time and energy efficiency

3. Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance
Algorithm Used: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Map the environment using LiDAR and Camera
- Update robot position in real-time
- Use obstacle avoidance (Reactive + Predictive)

4. Object Detection and Pickup
Algorithm Used: YOLOv5 + Barcode Scanning
- Detect item using camera and object detection model
- Scan barcode to confirm correct item
- Use 6DOF robotic arm for item gripping
- Validate with load cell (weight check)

5. Item Delivery
- Calculate new path to delivery station
- Monitor obstacles and reroute if needed
- Place item accurately on conveyor or bin

6. System Update
- Log operation (item, robot ID, time)
- Update stock levels in database
- Send completion status to WMS
